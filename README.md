# google-homepage
odin project initial assignment
recreate google.com homepage

First time building a simple webpage.
Figured out how to place headers and footers with links both left and right of page, customize hover options, button look, placement of main images and search forms.
Experimented with moz-linear-gradient (copied from looking at actual google.com)
Gained comfort differentiating margin vs padding and editing things from developer tools within the browser.
Took about 5 hours over 2.5 days to get to finished point at 1/5/2020
Need to work on actually using Git to save changes along the way.
